Hello everyone, and welcome to my homepage. I am a first-year PhD student in Management & Marketing department in Hong Kong Polytechnic University.  My research interest is Management Information System.

I received my bachelor's degree from Nanjing University, and my undergraduate thesis was titled "Impact of Virtual Avatars on Video Creators’ Productivity: An Empirical Study Based on the Bilibili Video Platform."

I'm still in the early stages of my journey, so I don't have many results to showcase yet. Feel free to drop by later—this page will level up along with me!
